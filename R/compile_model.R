  ### note april 28, 2025
  ### functions are not found when higher up folders have spaces in it!!!
  # error with "fp packages and analyses/fpet2" but runs fine for "fp_packages/fpet2"
  ##### older code/comments related to using instantiate yes/no ####
  # before using instantiate, we have functions in an include folder
  # instantiate doesn't like that so we moved these functions in the model fit itself
  # in addition, the folder itself had to be renamed??
  # code that may or may not be helpful :)
  # include_paths <- system.file("include", package = "BayesCoverageIndicators")

  #stan_file_path <- here::here("inst/stan/fpem.stan")

  #### extra code to consider for passing priors as strings ####
  # what does this code do:
  # allows the user to use TAGS in the stan model file and replace those by strings that are passed in as arguments
  # example:
  # use argument rho_prior = "dnorm(0, 0.5)" in fit_model call
  # {{RHO_PRIOR}} in stan model is replaced by this value, ie this is what code in stan model looks like
  #// rho_estimate[1] ~ {{RHO_PRIOR}} T[0, 1];
  #// tau_estimate[1] ~ {{TAU_PRIOR}} T[0, positive_infinity()];
  # Replace tags with correct values
  #      stan_code <- readr::read_file(stan_file_path) %>%
  #     stringr::str_replace_all("\\{\\{RHO_PRIOR\\}\\}", rho_prior) %>%
  #     stringr::str_replace_all("\\{\\{TAU_PRIOR\\}\\}", tau_prior)
  #     temp_stan_file_path <- cmdstanr::write_stan_file(stan_code)
